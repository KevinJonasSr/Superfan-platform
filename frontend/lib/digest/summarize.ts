/**
 * AI-generated 1-line "vibe of the week" summaries per community block.
 *
 * Given a fan's DigestPayload (already gathered by gather.ts), call
 * Claude Haiku 4.5 once per community block to produce a single
 * sentence summarizing what happened. Result is mutated onto each
 * block's `vibe_summary` field.
 *
 * We could batch ALL of a fan's community summaries into one prompt
 * (cheaper, fewer round-trips), but per-community calls give us
 * cleaner failure modes — if one summary fails, we still have the
 * others — and Haiku is fast enough that the latency hit is small
 * (~1 sec per community × at most 3 communities).
 *
 * Keeps API key access in one place via the same client wrapper as
 * lib/moderation/client.ts (different prompt, same model).

Output exactly ONE sentence, 12-22 words, no leading "This week" or
"Here's what happened". Lead with a verb or a specific reference. Avoid
generic adjectives ("great", "amazing", "exciting"). Reference at least
one specific detail from the posts or events you're given.

Examples of the tone we want:
  * "RaeLynn dropped a tour announcement and fans flooded the comments with
    Tennessee venue requests — Charlotte and Knoxville both trending."
  * "Bailee teased a studio session and the merch drop poll has bronze fans
    debating sleeve lengths."
  * "Quiet week in Konnor's club — one new poll about setlist closers, six
    replies, no announcements."

NEVER include emoji. NEVER use exclamation points. Keep it newsroom-dry,
not cheerleader-loud.`;
